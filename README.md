Yet another attempt at a game engine based on Cherno's [game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).

Disclaimer: I am neither a professional game programmer nor a very strong C++ programmer.

I am a professional software engineer working on C# and JavasScript projects, so I thought it might be fun to do something a little different. The plan is to follow along with Cherno's Hazel development videos and adapt it to a game engine I could use in a C# project. It might be cool. It might be an epic failure. Either way, it should be interesting.
