# Fargrid

Yet another attempt at a game engine based on Cherno's [game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).

Disclaimer: I am neither a professional game programmer nor a very strong C++ programmer.

I am a professional software engineer working on C# and JavasScript projects, so I thought it might be fun to do something a little different. The plan is to follow along with Cherno's Hazel development videos and adapt it to a game engine I could use in a C# project. It might be cool. It might be an epic failure. Either way, it should be interesting.

## Notes from the videos

- I actually started the project by following along in the [Project Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG8cAGvn9d4&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=4) video. I used "Fargrid" whereever Cherno used "Hazel" and "FG" whereever he used "HZ".

- I followed along in the [Entry Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meARMOmTLgE&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=5) to set up the application entry point.

- I intend to create a C# project called `Fargrid-Client` or something in the future. Specifically, when Cherno decides to convert Hazel to a static library, I will create an additional C++ CLI project to export to .NET. That's when things should start to get really interesting. Stay tuned.
